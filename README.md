## About Profit First

Profit First is a cash management system developed by Mike Michalowicz that helps businesses achieve profitability by flipping the traditional accounting formula:

**Traditional**: Sales - Expenses = Profit  
**Profit First**: Sales - Profit = Expenses

By allocating profit first, you ensure your business remains profitable from day one.
